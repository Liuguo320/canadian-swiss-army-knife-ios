## Proposal

Our proposal for the final project is an iOS application which offers a bunch of small tools, just like what a swiss army knife does.

The following tools are what we have and are connected by Tab Bar Controller:
Searching general / specific field questions (powered by google and web view)
Unit Converter (using Measurement)
Camera 
Map 

The first tool (searching) consists of a searching screen and a results screen. Users can navigate screens forth and back (using segue)

In the second tool (unit converter), users can convert units of area, length, volume, etc.

The third tool (camera) allows users to take pictures.

The fourth tool (Map) will show users the current location.
